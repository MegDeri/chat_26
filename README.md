## Chat

## Project description:
It is a simple live chat App created with React  and Socket.io framework. The goal was to use Socket.io framework for the first time in my projects.
The user can not only write a new message, but also edit or delete it (all changes will be visible to all users at the same time).

## Technology stock:
- React
- Socket.io

- use command `node index.js` to start server,
- in another command prompt use `npm start` to start App, works on port: localhost:8080,
- use different browsers to type and send messages on chat.
